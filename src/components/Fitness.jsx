        Over the past six years, I’ve developed a consistent and effective
        fitness routine that adapts to the seasons.

        During the cold months, I hit the gym six days a week, focusing on two
        muscle groups per workout. I train each muscle group twice a week, and
        every session lasts about 45 minutes.

        My weekly schedule runs from Monday to Saturday, with Sunday reserved as
        my rest day to recover and recharge.

        When the weather warms up, I take my workouts outside and switch to a
        lighter, more functional approach. I focus on calisthenics, doing lots
        of pull-ups, push-ups, and core exercises. These outdoor sessions allow
        me to stay active while enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.

        This seasonal approach has helped me stay consistent, build strength,
        and maintain a balanced fitness routine year-round.
