        For the past few years, Iâ€™ve adopted intermittent fasting as a
        consistent and effective approach to my nutrition.

        I have two meals each day: my first meal is at 11:30 AM, and my second
        meal is at 6:00 PM. This schedule keeps me feeling energized and focused
        throughout the day.

        Recently, I decided to give up sugar, but I still enjoy a variety of
        berries and grapefruit after meals. These provide natural sweetness and
        are packed with nutrients.

        I make sure to stay hydrated by drinking about 2.3 liters of water
        daily. After workouts, I replenish with a protein shake made with almond
        or hazelnut milk, which supports recovery and muscle growth.

        This approach has helped me maintain a balanced and sustainable
        lifestyle, keeping me healthy and energized year-round.
